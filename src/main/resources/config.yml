rounding:
  # Enable rounding for dates in food. If disabled, this means each food item
  # will be accurate to the millisecond, which effectively means they will never stack.
  #
  # Values:  true, false
  # Default: true
  enabled: true

  # The resolution for rounding. The less accurate the rounding, the more items can stack.
  #
  # Values:  "SECONDS", "HOURS", "MINUTES", "DAYS"
  # Default: "HOURS"
  time-resolution: "HOURS"

# Enable mixing for food items. If enabled, players can merge two food stacks with different
# expiry dates and the older stack will be favoured. You can merge a stack by clicking
# on another stack (of the same type) holding another stack. A sound will play if you
# successfully merge stacks.

# Values:  true, false
# Default: true
